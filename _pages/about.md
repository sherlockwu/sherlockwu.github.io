## Biography

I work at [SystemsResearch@Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/google-creates-new-systems-research-group) (SRG).
My research interests include operating systems, storage, and distributed systems.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2022), where I worked with awesome [Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/) and [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/). 
I also received my master's degree from UW-Madison (2020).
I received my B.E. from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC, 2016).

## Research
I have a broad interest in systems. My recent research aims to improve memory efficiency of hyperscalers and flatten their memory costs. It extends my PhD work on building systems for emerging storage architecture (tiering and disaggregation) and devices (Flash and Optane).

**Key Words:** Memory Management, Caching/Tiering, Multi-tenancy, Data-intensive Applications.


### Emerging Storage/Memory Devices
- Characterizing Ultra Low Latency SSDs \[[UnwrittenContract, HotStorage'19](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/hotstorage-contract19.pdf)\]
- Performance Isolation, Fairness, and Sharing on Persistent Memory \[[NyxCache, FAST'22](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast22/presentation/wu)\]
- External Sorting on Byte-addressable Storage \[[WiscSort, VLDB'23](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2103-banakar.pdf)\]

### Tiering/Disaggregation
- Search Engine on Tiny Memory and Large Flash Systems \[[WiSER, FAST'20](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast20/presentation/he)\]
- Non-hierarchical Caching for Modern Storage Hierarchies \[[Orthus, FAST'21](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/wu-kan)\] 
- Efficient Atomic Commit with Disaggregated Shared Log \[[Cornus, VLDB'22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10185.pdf)\]
- Learned Cache Admission Polcies for Dynamic-Sized CDN Caches \[[SLAP, IPDPS'23]()\]
- Semantically-smart Disaggregated Memory \[[IMP, InSub]()\]
- Field-granularity Caching for OLTP Databases \[[Alchemy, InSub]()\]

### Data-intensive Applications
- Reducing Hotspot Contention with Early Lock Release \[[Bamboo, SIGMOD'21](https://scarletguo.github.io/files/rdm447-guoA.pdf)\]
- Scalable Graph Mining with Approximate Pattern Decomposition \[[Arya, NSDI'23](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi23-zhu.pdf)\]
