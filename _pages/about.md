## Biography

I am a researcher at [SystemsResearch@Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/google-creates-new-systems-research-group) (SRG).
My research interests include operating systems, storage, and distributed systems.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Computer Sciences, 2022), where I worked with awesome [Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/) and [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/). 
I also received my master's degree from UW-Madison (2020).
I got my B.E. from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC, 2016).

## Research
I'm broadly interested in systems. Recently, I build systems for new storage **devices** (e.g., Flash, PMEM) and new storage **architecture** (e.g., tiering, disaggregated storage).

### Systems for New Storage Devices
- Search Engine on Tiny Memory and Large Flash Systems \[[WiSER, FAST'20](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast20/presentation/he)\]
- Performance Isolation, Fairness, and Sharing on Persistent Memory \[[NyxCache, FAST'22](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast22/presentation/wu)\]
- Characterizing Ultra Low Latency SSDs \[[Optane-UnwrittenContract, HotStorage'19](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/hotstorage-contract19.pdf)\]

### Systems for New Storage Architecture
- Non-hierarchical Caching for Modern Storage Hierarchies \[[Orthus, FAST'21](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/wu-kan)\]
- Efficient Atomic Commit with Disaggregated Shared Log \[[Cornus, VLDB'23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10185.pdf)\]
- Reducing Hotspot Contention with Early Lock Release \[[Bamboo, SIGMOD'21](https://scarletguo.github.io/files/rdm447-guoA.pdf)\]
- Field-granularity Caching for OLTP Databases \[[Alchemy, InSub]()\]


### Data Analytics Systems and Machine Learning for System
- Scalable Graph Mining with Approximate Pattern Decomposition \[[Arya, InSub]()\]
- Learned Cache Admission Polcies for Dynamic-Sized Caches \[[SLAP, InSub]()\]
